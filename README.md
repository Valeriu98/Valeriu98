👋 Hi, I’m @Valeriu98

🚀 iOS Developer

🛠 I’m currently diving deep into iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI, building modern, native apps with clean architecture and intuitive UI.

📱 Passionate about creating sleek, performant mobile experiences that scale — whether it’s through UIKit or SwiftUI.

👨‍💻 Previously worked on JavaScript full stack projects using Vue.js, React, Node.js (Express), and MySQL with Sequelize ORM.

🔁 Transitioned from full stack to mobile, but still bring strong backend and frontend fundamentals into my iOS projects.

🧪 Exploring best practices with Combine, MVVM, CoreData, RESTful APIs, and unit testing.

📚 Always learning! Currently leveling up in:

- Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, iOS SDKs
- Mobile app architecture and design patterns
    
💡 Past projects include work in Python, Java, and game development with Godot.
